  <h1><strong>My Pet.</strong></h1>
  <p>My pet, <em>Lisa</em>, is a cat. I'd like to think that despite her Australian origin, she is quickly getting used to life in Kenya.</p>
  <p> Infact, I would say that she loves it here evident by how excited she gets when a chance to hunt the numerous rats in our cereal store emerges.</p>
  <p>Her favotite toy is the rubber softball that she is always chasing around whenever she is not asleep</p>
  <p>Also, she would never miss a chance to play fetch especially when its   warm outside. This game particularly portrays not only her agility but also her quick reflexes.
  She is a true testament to the vast number of ways in which animals can be great friends with humans.
